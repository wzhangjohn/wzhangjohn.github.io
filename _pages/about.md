I am a Year 3 PhD student at the Department of Economic History, London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).

My research addresses topical debates in political economy, technological change and social policy, from a historical perspective.

I am passionate about applying generative artificial intelligence and broader deep-learning techniques in my research. Click [here](/research/) to learn more!
